# Electric_vehicle_segmentation
Problem Statement:
This report aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicles Market in India by employing segmentation analysis. The objective is to identify the most promising segments of the market, based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioural factors, and to devise a feasible market entry strategy accordingly. The study will focus on various segments such as region, price, charging facility, type of vehicles (e.g., 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, 4-wheelers, etc.), retail outlets, manufacturers, body type (e.g., Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, Autorickshaw, etc.), safety features, plug types, and more. Through this analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights to businesses looking to enter the Indian Electric Vehicles Market and help them make informed decisions about their market entry strategy.

Market segmentation
Market segmentation is the process of dividing customers into subgroups based on their characteristics. There are two approaches to market segmentation - a-priori and post-hoc. The a-priori approach uses predefined characteristics to create segments, while the post-hoc approach identifies segments based on the relationship among measured variables. This study uses an a-priori approach to segment potential EV customers. The study suggests that using a blend of psychographic and socioeconomic attributes is useful in formulating sub-market strategies that satisfy specific consumer preferences. The study also recommends using perceived-benefit characteristics guided by blended psychographic and socio-economic aspects for segmenting the consumer market. Previous research has shown that psychographic characteristics are more useful than socio-demographic and economic ones in explaining environmentally-conscious consumer behaviour.

Geographical dataset
Conducting data manipulation to extract relevant fields from the dataset.
Creating custom functions for generating plots that group data based on specific features and provide insights.
Eliminating features from the dataset that have little or no relevance to electric vehicles.
Cleaning numerical data by converting string values to floating-point values.
Combining relevant data frames to generate a visualisation of electric vehicle market insights on a map of India.
Behavioural Dataset:
Consumer characteristics, namely Age, Profession, Marital Status, Education, No. of Dependents, Car Loan, Total Salary (Combined salary in case married) are compared to the price of the purchased Electrical Vehicle.
Clusters are formed based on inferences drawn from analysis.
Categorical value count is compared with EV price
Inference is drawn on clusters formed.
Vehicle Specification segmentation
The observation of the prevalent body type of electric vehicles in India suggests that there may be potential competition for a company if it chooses to produce EVs in the same compact SUV category. However, it is possible for a company to establish a monopoly in the market by manufacturing EVs in other categories, such as hatchbacks or premium hatchbacks.
From this dataset, the price range does not give much information. It is worth noting that a majority of the EVs in India have a seating capacity of 5 seats. Thus, a company that introduces an EV with a higher seating capacity could potentially reap profits.
As per the Boot Space graph, it is evident that there is a dearth of EVs in the 0L - 300L range, with most of the available EVs having a boot space capacity in the range of 400L - 600L.
