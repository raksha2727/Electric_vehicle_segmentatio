Marketing Segmentation

Market segmentation is a marketing approach in which groups of consumers are identified so that particular items or product lines can be presented to them in a way that appeals to their interests. Market segmentation recognises that not all clients have the same interests, purchasing power, or consumer wants. Market segmentation is crucial since it aims to make a company's marketing efforts more strategic and focused rather than broadly appealing to all potential customers. A business can improve its chances of making sales and becoming more resource-efficient by creating specialised plans for certain items with target consumers in mind.
